  <p>This is Everest, also known as Kitty, Titten, and Lil Baby. My boyfriend and I rescued her from the Michigan Animal Rescue in Pontiac and it was the best decision we have ever made! We got her just a few days before my birthday and she was with us for Christmas! She is almost 1 year old. She terrorizes my dog, Bailey. Everest loves:
  <ul class="EverestLoves">
    <li>Knocking things off the counter</li>
    <li>Sleeping in the sun</li>
    <li>Running from room to room quickly for no reason</li>
    <li>Swatting at running sink water</li>
    <li>Annoying Bailey</li>
    <li>Stalking in the grass on her kitty leash</li>
    <li>Eating</li>
    <li>Catching flies and the occasional mouse</li>
  </ul>
