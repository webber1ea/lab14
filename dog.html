  <p>This is my pup Bailey. She is a Minature Golden Doodle. She is 9 years old and is still a puppy dog. Bailey enjoys barking, eating, sleeping, and meeting new people. I have had Bailey since she was a little baby pup and she is my best friend. Bailey does not seem to mind Everest, but does not really pay too much attenttion to her. Bailey loves:
